      <h1><a name="h-1-general-1" class="anchor" href="#h-1-general-1"></a><strong>1. General</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>You must be 13 and over to access V.II.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>While we cannot realistically verify the age of all users, if you claim anywhere that you are younger than 13 you will be swiftly ejected from the premises, and if you want to come back you will have to provide a valid form of ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This applies to both the website <em>and</em> the Discord.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post clearly and in English.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Posts must be readable (i.e., don’t overuse special characters to style your message) and in English.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We allow non-English discussions within the Discord chats as long they are not needlessly extensive and do not overtake English speakers. The use of a language other than English on the forums is prohibited.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Read your message out loud before posting. If it sounds stupid even to yourself, others will likely think the same. Don’t post that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don’t swear unnecessarily because it makes you and your post sound stupid and immature. Like everything, it’s best in moderation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not evade the word filter.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We don’t filter all curse words, just bad words. This is not only to protect other users from indecency but it also protects this community, so contribute to the server by respecting the filter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accidentally evading the filter can happen, but if it’s repeated we will assume you are doing it on purpose and accordingly moderate your account.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t be a prick.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No harassment (e.g., continuing annoying behavior even when someone told you to stop), no brigading (e.g., sharing someone else’s annoying behavior), no posting of content that may be damaging to one’s health (e.g., content sensitive to epileptics), no use of slurs (e.g., sensitive racial words).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not post anyone’s personally identifying information, including (but not limited to) their real name, address, phone numbers, pictures of themselves, and contact information.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do not <em>threaten</em> to post or otherwise obtain/research anyone’s personally identifying information either.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not reply to help threads if you don’t intend to help. Replies such as “I don’t know” when someone is asking a question are useless and borderline spammy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not accuse people of malicious behavior if you don’t have sufficient material to prove it. “Sufficient material” is defined by the moderator judging a case, but usually includes recorded chat logs or voice chat audio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not partake in concerntrolling, which is which is when you exhaust your time and resources to express some kind of false concern you have with another user, the site, or the staff, for the purpose of trolling/wasting time and not because you actually have the concern.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not call out users who have not posted in a thread yet, pressuring them to respond to an article or post that they may not want or need to, regardless of their post history.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not advocate, suggest, or even partake in raiding. Raiding other places, Discord servers, or forums will cause a mess and is going to get you banned everywhere <em>including</em> here. It’s not tolerated at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not trick other users into breaking rules. We will eject you from the premises if you achieve in doing so or just try to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even if they are jokes, don’t state things that are overly incriminating of yourself (e.g., “I sold drugs to children!”). Our moderation team has been instructed to take these incriminating statements at <strong>face value</strong> and we will permanently ban you if it’s severe enough.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No referrals or advertising garbage, unless in the marketplace.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unless given explicit permission to post from a mod/admin, don’t post links to Discord servers, don’t post referral links (e.g., links that make you money using a promotional code), and don’t promote or advertise businesses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This includes requesting money (such as PayPal donations, cryptocurrency addresses, or the GoFundMe for your cousin’s boyfriend’s grandmother’s sick dog) in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This rule does not apply to the marketplace. Feel free to do whatever there.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No NSFW content.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“NSFW” content is defined as “inappropriate” content, and “inappropriate” can include things like racial slurs, material promoting suicide, and of course 18+ content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Linking</em> to NSFW content is forbidden too. Also, please do not privately DM anyone with NSFW content unless they have granted you explicit permission to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This includes your avatar and/or profile banner. If you participate in chat with a NSFW avatar and/or profile banner and you refuse to change it we will remove you from the premises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cropped or otherwise censored NSFW content also counts as NSFW content even if the more explicit parts of the image have been cut-out. Basically think of how a “middle aged Christian soccer mom boss” would think if they saw it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“Lolicon” or “Shotacon” content will be considered illegal pornography and we will swiftly eject you from the premises if you not only share it but also extensively discuss it. Mentioning it in an objective sense, i.e. “X game is banned from Steam because of concerns over controversial depictions of Y” is acceptable in passing, but leave it at that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No spam.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Spam” is broadly defined but ranges from repeated messages to ASCII art. If it disrupts the flow of conversation, it will be considered spam. If it’s annoying, it will be considered spam. On the Discord server, if you use a self-bot or a Discord plugin, it will be considered spam.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Posting the same text, phrase, or image/video multiple times in a row is spam even while posted by different users because it is considered duplicate posting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other examples that may be considered spam include Discord/browser crashers, fake or expired Discord Nitro gifts, or videos that dynamically resize resolution as it plays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No multi-accounting.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Should be straightforward. Don’t use multiple accounts to interact with either the site or the Discord. If we catch you on a new account, your previous account will be ejected from the premises and you will be stuck on your alt as we will assume it is your new and preferred account.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No impersonation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not impersonate anyone else in this community, <em>especially</em> staff. Impersonation has to be demonstrated to be willful (e.g., someone tries to pretend he is someone else for a gain), and not accidental (e.g., someone incidentally has a similar username that someone else has).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating, distributing, or posting doctored screenshots of conversations will be considered impersonation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No advocating for violence.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We don’t care what your opinion is on the latest global conflicts we are unfortunately experiencing, but if you say anything that advocates the harming of innocents (“innocents” defined as <em>non-combatants</em> in the military context) or the senseless harming of people in general then you will be swiftly ejected from the premises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No advocating for gambling.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Our opinion on gambling, regardless if real or virtual, is the same as our opinions on most other vices. While you may discuss gambling in an objective manner (e.g., “X gambling site is currently being sued in a class-action lawsuit by Y”), do not mention them extensively, do not link to them, and do not advocate for their use.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not try to harm the website or its Discord server.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This includes DDoSing the site, trying to get into the site’s infrastructure using any method, or trying to report the site with falsified information to harm it. If severe enough we will gather your information and report you to the relevant authorities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This includes chargebacking any payments you made towards the site. If you want a refund on something, discuss it with an administrator first and we’ll see what we can do.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="h-2-content-sharing-2" class="anchor" href="#h-2-content-sharing-2"></a><strong>2. Content Sharing</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>All download links must be accompanied by a <a href="https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload">VirusTotal</a> link.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are uploading plaintext (e.g., code) then use a website like <a href="https://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a> so you don’t have to upload the file directly. Otherwise, all files must have a VirusTotal link associated for our users’ safety.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t post or link to warez (pirated content).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can discuss piracy, but don’t link to anything specifically, including torrents or links to pirate sites. Posting or linking to abandonware is okay if you legally cannot purchase said content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t post or link to cracks.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to our warez rule, don’t post or link to software/video game cracks/pirated license keys, unless they are for abandonware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t post or link to malware.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This one is pretty much self-explanatory. Don’t post or link to malware, such as viruses, worms, spyware, the whole lot.</li>
<li>Trollware (e.g., software that you pretend is something else, or software that pretends to be something else) will be considered malware.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t post URL shorteners.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>It is relatively simple to misdirect people using URL shorteners. If you’re linking to something, directly link to it. Yes, this includes for-profit shorteners, such as Adfly or Linkvertise.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t post stolen credentials.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, account dumps or phished credit cards. Sharing stolen credentials objectively makes the world a worse place and you are an idiot if you think it’s worthwhile.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t repost someone else’s content if it’s still available.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A beautiful painting of a puppy that someone else made, while adorable, doesn’t need to be shared again if we can still find it on the site in some shape or form. It will be considered duplicate content.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t repost someone else’s proprietary content if it’s still on sale.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If someone sells you an e-book and you see fit to share that e-book with the rest of the world then we will swiftly eject you from the premises for disrupting business. Applies for any other goods and services, intangible or not.</li>
<li>An exception may be made if the content is no longer for sale and the seller has essentially disappeared from the premises.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Samples must be provided to the site’s staff for quality verification.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are selling something and the site’s staff is requesting access for quality verification, you must provide it unless you have a really good reason not to. In return, the staff will promise to vouch for whatever product or service you are offering.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copyright takedowns will be respected.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you post something that infringes upon somebody else’s copyright and they send us a notice to take it down, we will take it down, no questions asked. While you may not necessarily get moderated for it the first time, avoid reposting the same content that got us in trouble.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most jurisdictions have laws stating that no provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider, thereby absolving the website of responsibility in these circumstances (e.g., Section 230(c)(1) in the U.S., Directive 2000/31/EC in the European Union). That, however, does not protect you from copyright infringement, so we will take moderation action if necessary for both your safety and ours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="h-3-post-etiquette-3" class="anchor" href="#h-3-post-etiquette-3"></a><strong>3. Post Etiquette</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Do not cross-post, double-post, or otherwise duplicate any message.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Any posts that simply duplicate the content of another existing post is prohibited. Depending on what’s posted, it may be considered spam.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No necroposting.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Necroposting is defined as reviving an old, inactive thread that hasn’t received any activity for over three weeks (21 days).</li>
<li><em>Exceptions</em>: You are the owner of your thread (OP) and you are posting significantly new information, such as an update to your program. In that case, necroposting is permitted.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>No useless bumping.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A “bump” is defined as replying to a thread in order to bring it back to users’ attention. If you bump without a purpose (e.g., just stating things in the bump reply that do not contribute to an ongoing discussion) then it will be moderated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Follow the OP’s rules.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you reply to a thread and the OP has set certain rules for discussion, you have to abide by these rules, unless they contradict the rules set herein. We won’t moderate your account if you infringe a thread’s rules but we will remove your replies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Post support requests in the appropriate product/service thread.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you need help with something you bought from the site, post in the official thread(s) representing the product or service, instead of making a whole new thread altogether.</li>
<li><em>Exceptions</em>: If the product or service doesn’t have an official presence on the site, in which case you are free to make a thread about it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Don’t use custom font size/colors for the entirety of your content.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>They are there to highlight important information. This rules page should be a fairly good example of how to color parts of posts by importance. In 95% of cases, you will not need custom colors/font size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h1><a name="h-4-moderation-and-enforcement-4" class="anchor" href="#h-4-moderation-and-enforcement-4"></a><strong>4. Moderation and Enforcement</strong></h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators are provided <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/carte%20blanche">carte blanche</a> to enforce these rules.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each infringement can receive a different punishment, which will be in accordance with the severity of the infringement and your past moderation history. There is no predefined severity of punishment for each broken rule, and there is rarely a specific interpretation provided.</li>
<li>Moderators are considered the absolute interpreters of the rules. Unless <em>another</em> moderator disagrees with how a rule was applied, it is useless for you to debate the interpretation of a rule and how it got applied in your case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators may edit, remove, or perform any other action on any content you post.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If we see that your content warrants editing (e.g., for clarity purposes, or to remove sensitive content) then we may edit it. You’re free to remove any edits we make but we’ll just end up deleting your post altogether if you’re persistent.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators are subject to the rules. No one is above the law.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Moderators can moderate other moderators if they break rules. You’re free to report a moderator for breaking rules to another moderator and it will be that moderator’s responsibility to issue punishment.</li>
<li>Moderators cannot unban themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators may not act on the will or in the interest of their affiliations.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For example, if a moderator is affiliated with McDonald’s, he must not ban or report back information to McDonald’s related to Burger King lovers. Likewise, if a moderator is also moderating another community, he may not use information from V.II to conduct research on someone that is both in our communities.</li>
<li>This rule also applies to moderator-ran businesses. A moderator cannot use information levied from V.II to seek communication with a consumer, for example.</li>
<li>Exception granted if it’s in order to fulfill the copyright obligations set in Rule 2.10. Exception is also granted if it’s for the safety of an external entity and its users and the moderator acts in good will.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators can permban if someone is willingly infringing the rules.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you are trying to willingly infringe the rules (e.g., we moderate you five times in a row for the same exact infringement) then moderators are given free reign to permanently ban you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators are free to unban anybody as long as there is cause.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While they can unban anybody with cause, do not expect the same clemency even if you were banned on similar terms. Each case is different and can be judged differently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators must not trade favors or else they will be ejected.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The old community had many problems with moderators accepting money in exchange for selective content removal or other favors. We will remedy this problem by swiftly ejecting <em>any</em> moderator that does favors to people, regardless what favor it was.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Users are expected to comply with a moderator’s investigation.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If a moderator is questioning you because of an ongoing investigation into a malicious user or a particularly severe infringement, you are expected to provide truthful answers or any evidence you have on hand of that testimony.</li>
<li>It’s fine if you don’t know, or have nothing to provide, <em>but</em> you have to say so. Don’t stay silent or try to avoid the question in any way.</li>
<li>Purposefully misdirecting a moderator to protect an investigated user will result in you getting the same punishment as the investigated user shall he end up punished.</li>
<li>A moderator <em>cannot</em> ask you for your DMs with another user <strong>unless</strong> that user in question is the one being investigated. In these circumstances, you should provide chat logs, preferably recorded.</li>
<li>This extends to group chats. They can only ask for chat logs from a group chat <em>if</em> the investigated user is in that group chat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Moderators are provided with state of exception powers in case something is particularly harmful to the site or its users.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>That is, a moderator may warn/mute/ban a user for reasons not listed in these rules if the content is exceptionally harmful, annoying, disgusting, or otherwise argued to warrant moderation. It cannot be reverted unless <em>another</em> moderator disagrees with the severity of the state of exception.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anyone can become a moderator. There is no formal induction process (yet).</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While we won’t provide random people with power, there is no defined process for becoming a moderator. Some may become moderators because of their experience in other communities, some may become moderators because they’ve known the old community well and can be trusted. We may come up with a process later but for now it is at the whim of the administration.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>We may change these rules at any time, for any reason, without prior notice.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This rule set will evolve over time as we adapt to the new state of the community.</li>
</ul>
</li>
