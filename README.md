# THE MÅR PARTY/STATE COUNCIL POLICY

**Created by: Spec**

**Modified by: Michael**

---

*There are FOUR current indices. The dash and then the number represent a new set of information/text. If an index has a decimal point, for example, Index 3-3.1, this would be a new set of text that is in accordance with the non-decimal point index, being Index 3-3. This is just an example and has nothing to do with the actual index 3-3.*

*Note: Councilmen are NOT staff; they are server politicians/influencers, similar to the senate. Councilmen are also encouraged to refer to the policy (this document) when making further inquiries.*

## PERMANENT MÅR NOTES

- A councilman and/or Head Command Leader can NOT create a new name for the state/party without including "Mår." This is dishonorable.
- Any logo changes/new sub-servers and other groups/fundraisers under Mår MUST contain a jera rune, as well as the colors: Purple, black, and white. This is part of the motive of our group.
  - Purple representing wealth, health, and royalty.
  - Black, representing authority.
  - White, representing purity and innocence.
- The Jera rune represents Jera symbolizes the ever-returning cycles, the life cycle, and fertility cycle. It is the rune of hope and continuous movement. It also represents new momentum, peace, and harmony.
  - For the person seeking advice, it signifies a period of waiting ahead.
  - In terms of the future, it means that a time of abundance may come.
